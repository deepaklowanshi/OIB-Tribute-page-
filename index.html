            Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, Gandhi dedicated his life to promoting peace, harmony, and justice. Through his teachings of truth, nonviolence, and compassion, he led the Indian National Congress and millions of people in the nonviolent disobedience campaign against British colonial rule.
